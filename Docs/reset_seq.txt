Reset sequences of a Microcontroller: Discussion
=======================================================================================

1) When you reset the MCU , The PC(Program Counter) of the processor is loaded with the value 0x0000_0000

2) Then processor reads the value @ memory location 0x0000_0000 in to MSP(Main Stack Pointer)

MSP = value@0x0000_0000
MSP is a Main Stack pointer register
That means, processor first initializes the Stack pointer register.

3) After that, processor reads the value @ memory location 0x0000_0004 in to PC .
That value is actually address of the reset handler.

4) PC jumps to the reset handler.

5) A reset handler is just a C or assembly function written by you to carry out any initializations required.

6) From reset handler you call your main() function of the application
